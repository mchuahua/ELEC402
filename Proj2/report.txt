Major tradeoff is that there are delays which contribute to some times where ready is asserted when it should not be for a few ps, during the high portion of the clk cycle.
(insert image of ready being asserted weirdly)

Also, it is harder to test as states are no longer enumerated within the synthesized output, and cannot be whitebox tested. The places where the tb whitebox tested needed to be commented out.

Otherwise, the waveforms seem to match:
(proj1 waveform all)
(proj2 waveform all)
